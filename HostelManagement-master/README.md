# Hostel Management
In todays time everything is easy. There is an app for ordering food , studying, booking tickets etc. But stil there are some fields which require innovation. In college hostels
you still have to give attendence manually. You have to walk upto the notice board to read notices . Hostel incharge must print and stick notices on the notice board.

As the name suggests Hostel Management App is an application that helps in every tasks in Student Dorms/Accomodations/Hostel.
It has different modules for diffent kind of poeple. There is a separate section for students, Hostel Incharge/Wardens , Parents Etc.
While entering this app we assume that you have already registered in this application. All the students and the wardens shall be given thier login id by the database incharge.

It has the following Features

1. students can view important notices from college as well as from the hostel.
2. Student can view Food Menu
3. Student can Give Hostel Attendence
3. Wardens can upload student notice. They can view student list as well as details of a particular student like attendence, Phone no etc
5. Parents can view information of thier student as well as hostel notices etc.

I have made this app using native android framework with the help of kotlin. The librarys used in this app are

1. Room database
2. Safe Args
3. Navigation Component
4. Data Binding
